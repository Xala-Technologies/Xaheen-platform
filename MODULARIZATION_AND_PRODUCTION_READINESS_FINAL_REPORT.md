- ✅ **Configurable templates** without core modification

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- ✅ **Consistent interfaces** across all generator implementations
- ✅ **Polymorphic command handlers** with unified contracts
- ✅ **Interchangeable components** maintaining behavioral contracts

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- ✅ **Minimal, focused interfaces** for each module
- ✅ **Optional feature interfaces** for advanced capabilities
- ✅ **Clean separation** between public APIs and internal implementations

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- ✅ **Dependency injection container** for service management
- ✅ **Abstract service interfaces** with concrete implementations
- ✅ **Configurable dependencies** through unified service registry

### 2.3 Key Architectural Improvements

**1. Modular Package Structure**
```typescript
// Example: Domain-specific package organization
packages/

├── design-system/           // Modular design tokens
└── xala-cli/               // UI system with hybrid scaffolding
```

**2. Enterprise Service Registry**
```typescript
// Unified service management with dependency injection
export class UnifiedServiceRegistry {
  private services = new Map<string, any>();
  private dependencies = new Map<string, string[]>();
  
  register<T>(name: string, service: T, deps: string[] = []): void {
    this.services.set(name, service);
    this.dependencies.set(name, deps);
  }
  
  resolve<T>(name: string): T {
    return this.instantiateWithDependencies(name);
  }
}
```

**3. Norwegian Compliance Integration**
```typescript
// NSM security classification throughout the system
export const NSMClassificationSchema = z.enum([
  'OPEN',           // Åpen
  'RESTRICTED',     // Begrenset  
  'CONFIDENTIAL',   // Konfidensielt
  'SECRET',         // Hemmelig
