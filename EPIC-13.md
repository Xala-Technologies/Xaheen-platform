Below is an **EPIC 13** that brings in your ‚ÄúPerfect Frontend Framework‚Äù plan, folded into the same checklist style:

---

## üìã **EPIC 13: Perfect Frontend Framework Implementation**

### **Story 13.1: Rails-Inspired Generator System**

*Enhance `xaheen generate` to cover every frontend artifact with AI-native workflows*

* [ ] Verify `xaheen g` alias for all frontend generators (model, component, page, layout, migration, seed, test, scaffold)
* [ ] Add dry-run (`--dry-run`) and force-overwrite flags to each generator
* [ ] Implement naming-convention enforcement and file-placement conventions per UI System
* [ ] Expose interactive prompts for missing params in all frontend generators

### **Story 13.2: Semantic UI System Template Modernization**

*Rewrite all frontend templates to use your Xala UI semantic components*

* [ ] Migrate Next.js/React/Vue/Svelte templates: replace raw HTML with `<Container>`, `<Stack>`, `<Text>`, `<Button>`, `<Card>`, etc.
* [ ] Embed design-token imports and i18n helpers into every template context
* [ ] Enforce WCAG AAA accessibility attributes in templates via a lint rule
* [ ] Validate Norwegian compliance tokens and NSM metadata in each template

### **Story 13.3: CLI Research-Driven Developer Experience**

*Infuse best practices from leading CLIs into your frontend workflow*

* [ ] Build a plugin architecture so users can drop in new generators for frontend frameworks
* [ ] Add command auto-completion, fuzzy matching, and contextual help for frontend commands
* [ ] Provide undo/rollback for template changes and generator actions
* [ ] Surface progress bars, diffs, and rich CLI output (emoji, color-coding) in frontend flows

### **Story 13.4: Advanced Template Inheritance & Composition**

*Enable reusable base templates and flexible composition for frontend*

* [ ] Define base templates (page, component, form, dashboard) with slots/partials
* [ ] Implement template inheritance so variants (dark mode, RTL, compliance) extend a common core
* [ ] Add local Hygen/Enquirer-driven templates within generated projects for ad-hoc scaffolding

### **Story 13.5: AI-Native Template System**

*Deeply integrate MCP intelligence into frontend template selection*

* [ ] Surface AI-driven pattern recommendations (e.g. grid vs list layout) at scaffold time
* [ ] Include token-usage estimates in template metadata for cost-aware generation
* [ ] Loop in AI-powered accessibility checks and compliance validations post-generation

### **Story 13.6: Documentation & Interactive Learning**

*Automate comprehensive frontend docs and tutorials*

* [ ] Generate Storybook config and sample stories for every generated component
* [ ] Create ‚ÄúYour First Component‚Äù in-CLI tutorial that walks through scaffold ‚Üí play ‚Üí refine
* [ ] Produce automatic MDX docs populated from template comments and design tokens

### **Story 13.7: Integration & QA for Frontend**

*Test every layer of your frontend generator and templates*

* [ ] Unit-test each generator and template helper with Jest/Vitest
* [ ] Integration-test template output renders in a headless browser (Playwright)
* [ ] E2E-test a full `xaheen scaffold frontend` ‚Üí `npm run build` ‚Üí `npm test` workflow
* [ ] Performance-test cold/warm scaffold times and template compile speed
