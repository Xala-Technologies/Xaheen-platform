To turn your full-featured CLI into an iterative, MVP-driven product, you can adopt a **phased testing strategy** that mirrors how you *would* have built the system—only now you’re validating what you’ve already built.

## 🛠 Phase 1: Frontend MVP (Next.js)

1. **Scaffold a Next.js Project**

   ```bash
   xaheen scaffold --preset=nextjs my-next-app
   cd my-next-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   * **Success Criteria**

     * Project boots in < 5s with no errors.
     * Generated pages render correctly (home, about stub).
     * Linting and type-checks pass (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`).

2. **Generate a Page & Component**

   ```bash
   xaheen web generate page Dashboard
   xaheen web generate component UserCard
   ```

   * **Validate**

     * `pages/Dashboard.tsx` exists, builds, and is reachable at `/dashboard`.
     * `components/UserCard.tsx` compiles and appears when imported.

3. **Automated E2E Smoke**

   * Write a simple Playwright script that:

     1. Boots the app.
     2. Navigates to `/dashboard`.
     3. Confirms the page title or component text renders.
   * Run in CI on every push to front-end code.

Once this phase is green, you know your **core CLI → Next.js DX** is solid.

## 🛠 Phase 2: Backend MVP

1. **Scaffold a Backend Service**

   ```bash
   xaheen scaffold --preset=backend-express my-api
   cd my-api
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   * **Success**: Server starts, `/health` or `/api` endpoint returns 200.

2. **Generate a Model & Endpoint**

   ```bash
   xaheen generate model User --fields="name:string email:string"
   xaheen generate endpoint User --type=rest
   ```

   * **Validate**

     * Database migration file is created.
     * `GET /users` and `POST /users` endpoints compile and respond as expected (use HTTPie or a small Jest supertest).

3. **Integration Test**

   * A Jest integration test that spins up the server, runs both the new endpoints, and asserts status codes and JSON shapes.

---

## 🛠 Phase 3: Frontend ⇄ Backend Integration

1. **Monorepo or Linked Workspaces**

   * Link your Next.js front-end to the local API (via `proxy` or CORS).

2. **Generate a “Fetch” Call**

   ```bash
   xaheen web generate service UserService --endpoint=/api/users
   ```

   * **Validate**

     * The generated `services/UserService.ts` contains a fetch call.
     * Front-end page consumes it and renders user data (use mock data if needed).

3. **E2E Full-Stack Test**

   * Playwright script:

     1. Boot both front and back.
     2. Create a user via API.
     3. Visit the page that lists users and assert the new user appears.

---

## 🛠 Phase 4: Services & Integrations

1. **Authentication Flow**

   ```bash
   xaheen generate integration auth --provider=bankid
   ```

   * **Smoke Test**: Verify the auth redirect URL and callback work in a real or mock BankID sandbox.

2. **Payments & Notifications**

   * Scaffold each integration, then write small scripts (or mocked tests) that trigger webhooks or API calls and assert the CLI’s boilerplate handles them (e.g. payment success webhook).

3. **Automated Contract Tests**

   * For each service, generate a Pact or OpenAPI contract and verify the generated stub matches expectations.

---

## 🛠 Phase 5: Secondary Frameworks & Advanced Features

1. **Vue/Svelte/PHP Scaffolds**

   * Repeat Phase 1–2 workflows for `--preset=vue` and `--preset=php-laravel` (or your PHP integration).
   * Confirm basic “new project → generate page/model → build/run” flows.

2. **Multi-Tenancy & Subscriptions**

   * Scaffold a multi-tenant app:

     ```bash
     xaheen scaffold --preset=multitenant my-saas
     ```
   * Validate tenant isolation in DB and tenant onboarding flows via automated tests.

3. **Full-Stack MVP CI Pipeline**

   * Create a CI job that runs the **Phase 1–5** smoke tests in sequence on each commit.
   * Gate merges behind green runs of all phases.

---

### 📈 Feedback & Iteration

* **Usage Metrics**: Instrument `xaheen` to log (anonymously) which commands succeed or fail during each phase.
* **Developer Surveys**: After Phase 1 and Phase 2, poll your internal team for pain points and UX friction.
* **Rapid Fixes**: Prioritize addressing blocking issues in each phase before moving to the next.

---

By **validating each technology slice in isolation**, then **integrating them step-by-step**, you preserve an MVP mindset—catching regressions early, gathering feedback often, and ensuring each layer of your “full” system actually delivers working value.
