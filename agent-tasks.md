## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Template Complexity**: Mitigate with fragment system
2. **Service Conflicts**: Mitigate with compatibility matrix
3. **Performance**: Mitigate with caching and parallelization
4. **Migration Issues**: Mitigate with backwards compatibility

### Process Risks
1. **Agent Coordination**: Daily syncs and clear handoffs
2. **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to story points
3. **Quality Issues**: Automated testing and validation
4. **Timeline Delays**: Buffer time in Phase 5

## Final Notes

This task distribution leverages each agent's expertise while ensuring clear boundaries and responsibilities. The CLI Template Generator serves as the lead agent, coordinating the overall architecture while specialized agents handle their specific domains.

All agents must maintain regular communication through the handoff documentation system and adhere to the quality gates defined above. Success depends on each agent completing their assigned tasks within the allocated story points while maintaining the high standards required for the Xaheen platform.
