# Documentation Reorganization Summary - Final Report

## Overview

The Xaheen codebase documentation has been successfully reorganized following a package-centric approach. Documentation now lives with the code it describes, improving maintainability and discoverability.

## Final Structure

### Package-Level Documentation

Each package now maintains its own comprehensive documentation:

1. **`/packages/xaheen-cli/docs/`** - Complete CLI documentation
   - Architecture, commands, generators, AI integration, compliance
   - Legacy docs moved to `/legacy-docs/` subfolder

2. **`/packages/mcp/docs/`** - MCP server and UI system documentation
   - MCP server guides and API reference
   - UI system compliance and integration docs in `/ui-system/`

3. **`/packages/xala-cli/docs/`** - Xala CLI documentation
   - Existing docs plus v2 documentation

4. **`/packages/design-system/docs/`** - Design system documentation
   - Ready for component documentation

5. **`/apps/web/docs/`** - Web application documentation
   - Wireframes and app-specific guides

### Root-Level Documentation (`/docs/`)

The root `/docs` folder now contains only project-wide documentation:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Navigation hub
├── project-docs/               # Epic plans and summaries
├── project/                    # Integration and release notes
├── reports/                    # Technical reports
├── archive/                    # Historical documentation
│   ├── brainstorming/         # Initial concepts
│   ├── planned/               # Future plans
│   ├── in-progress/           # WIP documentation
│   └── completed/             # Completed features
└── contributing/               # Documentation templates and guides
```

### Removed/Cleaned Up

The following have been removed from root `/docs`:
- ✅ `/api/` - Moved to package-specific docs
- ✅ `/architecture/` - Distributed to relevant packages
- ✅ `/guides/` - Moved to package-specific docs
- ✅ `/wireframes/` - Moved to `/apps/web/docs/`
- ✅ `/docs-v2/` - Content distributed and folder removed

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Each package owns its documentation
2. **No Duplication**: Single source of truth for each topic
3. **Better Discovery**: Documentation is where developers expect it
4. **Cleaner Root**: Only project-wide docs remain at root
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Package maintainers manage their own docs

## Migration Results

### Before
- Mixed documentation in `/docs/` and `/docs-v2/`
- Unclear ownership and organization
- Duplicate and outdated content
- Hard to find relevant documentation

### After
- Package-centric documentation structure
- Clear ownership and organization
- Single source of truth
- Easy navigation via package docs

## Contributing

A new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file has been created at the root level with:
- Development setup instructions
- Coding standards
- Documentation guidelines
- Pull request process

## Next Steps

1. **Update Links**: Review and update any hardcoded documentation links in code
2. **Expand Package Docs**: Encourage teams to add more documentation to their packages
3. **Add CI Checks**: Implement documentation linting and link checking
4. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic documentation reviews

## Summary

The documentation reorganization is complete. The codebase now follows a clean, maintainable documentation structure where:
- Package-specific docs live with the code
- Root docs contain only project-wide information
- Clear navigation and organization throughout
- Contributing guidelines are easily accessible
