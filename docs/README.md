# Xaheen Project Documentation

This directory contains project-level documentation for the Xaheen platform. Package-specific documentation has been moved to each package's `/docs` folder for better organization.

## üìÅ Structure

### Project Documentation
- **[`/project-docs/`](./project-docs/)** - Epic plans, implementation summaries, and major feature documentation
- **[`/project/`](./project/)** - Integration summaries, release notes, and project milestones
- **[`/reports/`](./reports/)** - Technical reports, architecture diagrams, and analysis documents

### Archive
- **[`/archive/`](./archive/)** - Historical documentation organized by status:
  - `/brainstorming/` - Initial concepts and ideas
  - `/planned/` - Future implementation plans
  - `/in-progress/` - Work in progress documentation
  - `/completed/` - Completed feature documentation

### Contributing
- **[`/contributing/`](./contributing/)** - Documentation standards, templates, and contribution guidelines
- See also: [`/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) at the root level

## üìç Where to Find Documentation

### Package-Specific Documentation

Each package maintains its own documentation:

- **MCP Server**: [`/packages/mcp/docs/`](../packages/mcp/docs/)
- **Xala CLI**: [`/packages/xala-cli/docs/`](../packages/xala-cli/docs/)
- **Design System**: [`/packages/design-system/docs/`](../packages/design-system/docs/)
- **Web App**: [`/apps/web/docs/`](../apps/web/docs/)

### Quick Links

- [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Main Repository README](../README.md)

## üìù Documentation Philosophy

We follow a **package-centric documentation approach**:

1. **Documentation lives with code** - Each package owns its documentation
2. **Single source of truth** - No duplicate documentation across packages
3. **Clear ownership** - Package maintainers manage their docs
4. **Easy discovery** - Developers find docs where they expect them

## üöÄ For New Contributors

1. Start with the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Check the package-specific docs for the area you want to work on
3. Review the `/contributing/` folder for documentation templates

**Note**: This is a minimal project-level documentation structure. Most documentation is now maintained within each package's `/docs` folder.
