# Storybook Configuration Fix - January 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing Addon Dependencies**
- **Problem**: `@storybook/addon-essentials` was missing from package.json
- **Solution**: Added the missing dependency to devDependencies

### 2. **Version Compatibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Storybook core was on v9.1.1 but addons were mixed versions, creating incompatibilities
- **Solution**: Standardized all Storybook packages to v8.6.14 for consistency:
  - `storybook`: 8.6.14
  - `@storybook/react`: 8.6.14 
  - `@storybook/react-vite`: ^8.6.14
  - `@storybook/addon-*`: ^8.6.14
  - `eslint-plugin-storybook`: ^0.8.0 (compatible version)

### 3. **Code Conflicts and Naming Issues**
- **Problem**: Duplicate "Card" declaration in Calendar.stories.tsx (import vs export)
- **Solution**: Renamed story export from `Card` to `CardVariant` to avoid naming conflict

### 4. **Duplicate Exports**
- **Problem**: `useTooltip` and `useAccessibleTooltip` exported twice in tooltip.tsx
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate exports from the export object, keeping individual function exports

### 5. **Missing Import Specifier**
- **Problem**: Import from `'storybook/viewport'` not found 
- **Solution**: Updated to correct import: `'@storybook/addon-viewport'`

### 6. **CSS Import Order Violation**
- **Problem**: @import statements placed after @tailwind directives in globals.css
- **Solution**: Moved @import statements to the top of the file (CSS specification requirement)

## Final Status
✅ **Storybook v8.6.14 running successfully on http://localhost:6006**  
✅ **All build errors resolved**  
✅ **Version compatibility established**  
✅ **Professional design system showcase ready**

## Next Steps
- Storybook is now ready for component documentation and testing
- All stories should load without errors
- Design system components can be viewed and interacted with in isolation
