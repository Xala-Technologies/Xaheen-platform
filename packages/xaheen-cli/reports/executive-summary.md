## 🚨 Critical Issues & Immediate Actions

### Priority 1: Fix Test Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: 28 out of 49 tests failing due to configuration problems
**Impact**: Blocks accurate performance measurement and CI reliability
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

**Specific Problems**:
- ESM import resolution: `runCodebuffCLI is not a function`
- Command conflicts: Duplicate `--verbose` and `--force` options
- Mock configuration: Service registry integration failures
- Process mocking: `process.emit is not a function` in test environment

**Action Items**:
1. Review and fix module resolution in `vitest.config.ts`
2. Resolve command parser conflicts in test setup
3. Improve service registry mocking strategy
4. Fix process event handling in test environment

### Priority 2: Increase Test Coverage (HIGH)

**Issue**: 87.3% of source files lack test coverage
**Impact**: High risk of undetected bugs, difficult refactoring
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks

**Coverage Targets by Area**:
- Core Services: 15% → 70% (AI, Database, Config, Logger)
- Command Handlers: 40% → 80% (Create, Remove, Validate, AI)
- Code Generators: 20% → 65% (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
- Utilities: 30% → 60% (File system, validation, templates)
