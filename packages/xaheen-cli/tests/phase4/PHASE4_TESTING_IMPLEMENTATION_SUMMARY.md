## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (90%+ Coverage Target)

**Model Generation Tests (`unit/model.test.ts`)**
- Tests model generation for all frameworks (NestJS, Express, Fastify, Hono)
- Validates TypeORM entities, Mongoose schemas, JSON schemas, and Zod schemas
- Tests field types, validation rules, relationships, and naming conventions
- Mocks template engine for isolated testing

**Endpoint Generation Tests (`unit/endpoint.test.ts`)**
- Tests controller/router generation for all frameworks
- Validates CRUD operations, HTTP methods, and status codes
- Tests authentication middleware, validation, and error handling
- Covers security features (CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization)

**Service Generation Tests (`unit/service.test.ts`)**
- Tests business logic layer generation
- Validates dependency injection, repository patterns, and CQRS
- Tests error handling, transactions, and performance optimizations
- Covers caching, batch operations, and event handling

### 2. Integration Tests (85%+ Coverage Target)

**Framework-Specific Integration Tests**
- **Express**: Complete Express project scaffolding with MongoDB/PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite
- **NestJS**: Full NestJS application with TypeORM/Prisma/Mongoose
- **Fastify**: Plugin-based architecture with JSON Schema validation
- **Hono**: TypeScript-first development with Zod validation and multi-runtime support

Each integration test covers:
- Project structure generation and validation
- Dependency installation using Bun
- Server startup and health check verification
- Feature integration (authentication, file upload, caching, etc.)
- Docker and Kubernetes configuration generation
- Testing setup and documentation generation

### 3. E2E Tests (Critical Path Coverage)

**CRUD Operations Testing (`e2e/crud.test.ts`)**
- Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete workflows
- Real database connections with SQLite for fast testing
- Cross-framework performance comparison
- Validation error handling and edge cases
- Bulk operations and pagination testing
- Authentication and authorization testing

### 4. Performance Tests (Baseline Establishment)

**Cold Start Performance (`performance/cold-start.test.ts`)**
- Server startup time measurement (< 2s requirement for Express/Fastify/Hono)
- Memory usage monitoring during startup
- Framework comparison benchmarks
- Performance regression detection
- Database connection impact on startup time

**API Latency Benchmarks (`performance/latency.test.ts`)**
- Single request latency measurement
- Concurrent load testing (up to 50 concurrent requests)
- Database operation latency (CRUD operations)
- Authentication and validation overhead measurement
- Framework performance comparison and baseline establishment

## Framework Performance Expectations

| Framework | Cold Start | Health Check | CRUD Latency | RPS Target |
|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Express   | < 2000ms   | < 50ms       | < 100ms      | 20+ req/s  |
| NestJS    | < 10000ms  | < 100ms      | < 200ms      | 15+ req/s  |
| Fastify   | < 1500ms   | < 30ms       | < 60ms       | 30+ req/s  |
| Hono      | < 1000ms   | < 25ms       | < 50ms       | 35+ req/s  |

## Test Utilities and Infrastructure
