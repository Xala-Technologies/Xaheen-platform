# Phase 10: Norwegian/NSM/DIGDIR/GDPR/WCAG Compliance Testing

Phase 10 is the **FINAL compliance gate** that ensures all generated code and templates meet Norwegian government standards and international compliance requirements.

## Overview

This phase tests compliance with:

- **BankID & Altinn Integration**: Official Norwegian authentication and government services
- **Digipost Document Submission**: Secure document handling with compliance metadata
- **NSM Security Classifications**: OPEN, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET data handling
- **DIGDIR Reporting**: Government digital service reporting standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection, consent management, and deletion workflows
- **WCAG 2.2 AAA**: Full accessibility compliance for generated UI components

- **Standards**: Norwegian document delivery standards

### 3. NSM Security Classifications
- **Classifications**: OPEN, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET
- **Coverage**: Template generation with security markers, audit logging
- **Standards**: NSM security framework

### 4. DIGDIR Reporting
- **Schema**: Official DIGDIR reporting schemas
- **Coverage**: Service registration, usage metrics, compliance reporting
- **Standards**: Norwegian digital service standards

### 5. GDPR Compliance
- **Coverage**: Consent management, data deletion, privacy by design

### 6. WCAG 2.2 AAA Accessibility
- **Tool**: axe-core automated testing
- **Coverage**: Generated UI components, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.2 Level AAA

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required dependencies
npm install @axe-core/playwright @types/node vitest playwright
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Norwegian test environment endpoints
export BANKID_TEST_ENDPOINT="https://eid-exttest.difi.no/"
export ALTINN_TEST_ENDPOINT="https://tt02.altinn.no/"
export DIGIPOST_TEST_ENDPOINT="https://api.digipost.no/test/"

# Test credentials (provided by Norwegian authorities)
export BANKID_TEST_CLIENT_ID="your-test-client-id"
export BANKID_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET="your-test-client-secret"
```

### Run All Phase 10 Tests

```bash
npm run test:phase10
```

### Run Specific Test Categories

```bash
# BankID/Altinn tests
npm run test:phase10:auth

# WCAG accessibility tests
npm run test:phase10:accessibility

# GDPR compliance tests
npm run test:phase10:gdpr

# NSM security tests
npm run test:phase10:security
```

## Compliance Requirements

### ✅ Pass Criteria

All tests must pass for the CLI to be considered compliant with Norwegian standards:

1. **Authentication Integration**: 100% success rate with BankID/Altinn test endpoints
2. **Document Submission**: Successful Digipost document handling with metadata
3. **Security Classifications**: Proper NSM classification handling and audit trails
4. **DIGDIR Reporting**: Valid schema compliance and successful API calls
5. **GDPR Workflows**: Complete consent and deletion workflow validation
6. **Accessibility**: 100% WCAG 2.2 AAA compliance for generated UI components

### ❌ Failure Handling

Any failed test blocks the release and requires immediate attention:

- Authentication failures indicate integration issues
- Document submission failures compromise compliance
- Security classification failures risk data exposure
- DIGDIR reporting failures prevent government service registration
- GDPR failures create legal compliance risks
- Accessibility failures exclude users with disabilities

## Integration with CI/CD

Phase 10 tests are automatically triggered:

1. **After Phase 9 completion**: Security and mutation testing must pass first
2. **Before production deployment**: Final gate before release
3. **On compliance-related code changes**: Triggered by changes to compliance modules

## Test Data and Mocks

### Official Test Environments

- **BankID**: Uses official Difi test environment with real test users
- **Altinn**: Uses TT02 test environment with synthetic business data
- **Digipost**: Uses official test API with document simulation

### Synthetic Data

- **GDPR**: Generated test users with consent histories
- **NSM**: Classified documents at all security levels
- **WCAG**: UI components with various accessibility scenarios

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Results

Results are logged to:
- **Console**: Real-time test progress
- **JUnit XML**: CI/CD integration
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Government reporting
- **Audit Logs**: Security and compliance tracking

### Metrics Tracked

- **Authentication Success Rate**: BankID/Altinn integration health
- **Document Processing Time**: Digipost performance metrics
- **Security Audit Trail**: NSM classification handling
- **GDPR Response Time**: Data deletion and consent processing
- **Accessibility Score**: WCAG compliance percentage

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes**:

1. **Test Credentials**: Never commit real credentials to version control
2. **Test Data**: Use only synthetic data for GDPR and security tests
3. **Network Access**: Tests require internet access to Norwegian test endpoints
4. **Audit Logging**: All compliance tests are logged for audit purposes
5. **Data Cleanup**: Test data is automatically cleaned up after execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure access to Norwegian test endpoints
2. **Test Credentials**: Verify credentials are properly configured
3. **Browser Dependencies**: Playwright requires browser binaries
4. **Rate Limiting**: Norwegian test endpoints have rate limits

### Support Contacts

- **BankID/Altinn**: support@difi.no
- **Digipost**: developer@digipost.no
- **NSM Compliance**: Contact through official channels
- **DIGDIR**: post@digdir.no

## Compliance Certification

Upon successful completion of Phase 10, the Xaheen CLI receives:

✅ **Norwegian Government Standards Compliance Certificate**
✅ **GDPR Data Protection Compliance Certificate**
✅ **WCAG 2.2 AAA Accessibility Certificate**
✅ **NSM Security Framework Approval**

These certifications enable deployment in Norwegian government environments and ensure full regulatory compliance.
